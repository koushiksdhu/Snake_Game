# Snake Game

This project is a Snake Game built using Python and the Turtle library. It is a classic arcade game where players control a snake to eat food and grow longer. The game provides an interactive and challenging experience for players to enjoy.

## Features

1. Game Interface: The application provides a graphical interface where players can see the snake, food, and score. The screen represents the game area, and the snake moves within this area.

2. Player Controls: The player controls the snake using the keyboard arrow keys. The snake moves in the direction specified by the arrow keys.

3. Food Generation: The game generates food at random locations within the game area. The snake needs to eat the food to grow longer and increase the score.

4. Snake Movement: The snake moves continuously in the direction specified by the player. It can change its direction only when the player presses an arrow key. The snake's body grows longer as it consumes food.

5. Collision Detection: The game detects collisions between the snake and the walls or its own body. Colliding with walls or the snake's body ends the game.

6. Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases each time the snake eats food. The score is displayed on the screen, and the game ends when the snake collides with a wall or its own body.

7. Sound Effects: The game includes sound effects for food consumption and game over events, enhancing the gameplay experience.

## Prerequisites

To run the Snake Game, ensure you have the following:

- Python (version 3.7 or higher) installed on your computer.

## Usage

1. Clone the GitHub repository or download the project files to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to start the Snake Game:
   ```
   $ python main.py
   ```

4. The game window will open, displaying the snake, food, and score.

5. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the movement of the snake. The snake will start moving in the direction specified by the arrow keys.

6. The objective of the game is to eat as much food as possible to increase the score and grow the snake's body.

7. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the score increases. The current score is displayed on the screen.

8. Be careful not to collide with the walls or the snake's own body. Collisions will end the game.

9. The game continues until the snake collides with a wall or its own body. The final score will be displayed on the screen.

10. To exit the game, close the game window or press the "Esc" key.

## Customization

You can customize the Snake Game by modifying the code in the `main.py` file. You can change the game settings, adjust the snake and food attributes, or add additional features to enhance the gameplay.
